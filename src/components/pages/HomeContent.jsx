              We created Jammin&apos; Jams with the intent of celebrating all that is happy in life
              by doing what we love. Jam invites us to live in the present moment. We aim to
              transform the best seasonal fruits into sweet-tart-oh-so-tasty jam through the power
              of high heat and bass. At Jammin&apos; Jams, we firmly believe that fun and passion
              can be tasted. This is why we will always play a live DJ set while making jam in our
              home kitchen. We keep our hearts pumping and our jams jammin with funky techno beats,
              and we hope youâ€™ll do the same! <Link to="/store">Sign up today</Link> to get your
