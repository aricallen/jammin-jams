        We created Jammin&apos; Jams with the intent of celebrating all that is happy in life by
        doing what we love. Jam invites us to live in the present moment. We aim to transform the
        best seasonal fruits into sweet-tart-oh-so-tasty jam through the power of high heat and
        bass. At Jammin&apos; Jams, we firmly believe that fun and passion can be tasted. This is
        why we will always play a live DJ set while making jam in our home kitchen. We keep our
        hearts pumping and our jams jammin with funky techno beats, and we hope youâ€™ll do the same!{' '}
